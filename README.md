# Package_TownRally_UI

TownRally

TownRally is my new project containing of different packages that work together.

Currently the packages are 
  Package_TownRally_UI - that handles user management, database, GUI
  Package_TownRally_RallySystem - rally system is a PokemonGO like educational game to learn about cities.
  ...more to come!
  
# UI

That part handles the user management, database and GUI.

Database and user management runs on Firebase.
Other added assets from Assetstore:
  EnhancedScroller v2
  Odin Inspector
  Newtonsoft Json
  and of course my beloved CodeEvents.
  
Project is currently strongly under development! So don't expect it to run properly at this moment.

Package has to be added to the project via Unitys ProjectManager.
